# Composite Pattern

## It is Structural Pattern
* Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object.
* composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy.
* Ex: File System, Arithmetic expressions.
```Java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Employee {
   private String name;
   private String dept;
   private int salary;
   private List<Employee> subordinates;

   // constructor
   public Employee(String name,String dept, int sal) {
      this.name = name;
      this.dept = dept;
      this.salary = sal;
      subordinates = new ArrayList<Employee>();
   }

   public void add(Employee e) {
      subordinates.add(e);
   }

   public void remove(Employee e) {
      subordinates.remove(e);
   }

   public List<Employee> getSubordinates(){
     return subordinates;
   }

   public String toString(){
      return ("Employee :[ Name : " + name + ", dept : " + dept + ", salary :" + salary+" ]");
   }   
}
```
